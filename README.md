Project Euler Solutions
=======================

![PE smacke badge](http://projecteuler.net/profile/smacke.png)

My solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, in
C++ and Python. At one point there was some Java in there too.
Unfortunately, I've lost a lot of my solutions due to carelessness, or
because I solved whatever problem in a Python interpreter.
